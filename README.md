# BlackJack

Implementation of blackjack on a web server. To play, simply click the "Play" button. Start values are anything you want at the top of the deck (must be in order, separated by commas). Remember, in blackjack, the dealer gets the first card, then the player, and so on. 

To run: "npm i" will install dependencies, and "node src/app.js" will start the server on localhost:3000.
